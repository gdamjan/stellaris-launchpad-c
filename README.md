launchpad
=========

Starter project for TI's Stellaris Launchpad that doesn't require you to have
StellarisWare installed. This saves you a 340MB download and various lengthly
click-through EULAs.
 
The BSD-licensed header file for the Launchpad's microprocessor (LM4F120H5QR)
is includedin this project. All you need is the flash tool (lm4tools) and a
compiler and there's a shell script that will fetch both of those for you.

Thanks must go to
